Liars-Dice-Django
=================

This is a version of the Liar's Dice game, in Django. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar's_dice if you've not heard of this game.)

It is playable as is, but not really finished. There is no AI, it's multiplayer only.

If you want to play it, you'll have to tweak it to run locally. At a minimum, you'll need to adjust settings.py with a valid sqlite path, and init the db. If you get stuck, drop me a note and I'll help you out.
